-- 073_customer_vehicles.sql
--
-- Built first for Al Hakeem Filling Station (its migration 801) and brought
-- to the master unchanged but for the number and the closing of its internal
-- functions (072).
--
-- One customer, many vehicles, one ledger.
--
-- Some of this pump's credit customers run 10 or 15 vehicles on one account.
-- The master gives a customer one vehicle_number box and records no vehicle on
-- a slip, so a fleet's account could say what was owed but not which truck
-- took it. Here a customer has a list of vehicles, every credit slip and every
-- lubricant sale on credit can name the vehicle, and the vehicle is carried
-- onto the ledger line the slip posts. The account stays ONE account: one
-- balance, one credit limit, payments off the one total.
--
--   customer_vehicles          the list, per customer. A vehicle number is
--                              unique among ACTIVE vehicles across the whole
--                              pump (ignoring case, spaces and dashes), so a
--                              number typed at the pump finds one account.
--   credit_sales.vehicle_id    } nullable: a slip without a vehicle is still a
--   lubricant_sales.vehicle_id } slip, and every slip from before this is one.
--   ledger_entries.vehicle_id  copied from the slip or sale by the posting
--                              triggers; never typed.
--
-- RULES IN THE DATABASE, as everywhere here. A vehicle used on a slip must
-- belong to that slip's customer and be active when the slip is saved. A
-- vehicle that has been used is never deleted (the foreign keys are RESTRICT,
-- and ledger_entries is append-only, so SET NULL would be refused anyway); it
-- is RETIRED (is_active = false) and keeps its old slips. One never used may
-- be deleted - a mistake when typing it in.
--
-- BACKUPS (051). customer_vehicles joins backup_table_order() straight after
-- customers, so a backup carries it and a restore loads it before the slips
-- that point at it. The three new columns are nullable, so a backup from before
-- this migration restores unchanged (its rows simply have no vehicle). A
-- backup taken BEFORE 073 has no customer_vehicles section, which the restore
-- reads as an empty list.
--
-- THE OLD vehicle_number BOX stays, as the customer's main vehicle: it is what
-- the customer list and the New customer form already show. Whatever is typed
-- there joins the vehicle list too (a trigger here), and every customer's
-- existing number is copied in once, below.
