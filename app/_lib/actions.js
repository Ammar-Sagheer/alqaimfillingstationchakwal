 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a way to set a meter back to zero. The old unit's
 * nozzles keep every reading they ever took, exactly as they took them - months
 * of litres, cash, credit and tank movement hang off those rows - and the new
 * unit gets nozzles of its own, starting wherever its meters actually start.
 * See migration 056 for why editing the existing rows is the wrong answer and
 * what it would do to the books.
 *
 * ALL THE REAL CHECKING IS IN replace_unit(). What is validated here is only
 * the shape of the form: whether a date is a date and a number is a number.
 * Whether the unit exists, whether it already has readings past the day it is
 * being retired on, whether the new labels collide - those are questions about
 * the state of the database at the moment of the write, and answering them here
 * would be answering them a second earlier than the answer is worth anything.
