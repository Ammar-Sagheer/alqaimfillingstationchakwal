 * per-day breakdown, and adding one would be a migration written to feed a
 * decoration. These select two columns over a bounded date range and add them
 * up in JavaScript, which for one month of deliveries and expenses is a few
 * dozen rows.
 *
 * NO `limit`, DELIBERATELY. `getExpenses` takes one and defaults it to 100,
 * which is right for a table that pages - and would be silently wrong here:
 * a cap on a list you are going to total is a cap on the total, so the 101st
 * expense of a month would just vanish from the line. See "Two traps, both
 * hit for real" in the skill's ui-patterns notes; this is that trap, and the
 * reason these are separate functions rather than a reused one.
 *
 * The grouping is by the business date the row is FILED under - `purchase_date`
 * and `expense_date` - not `created_at`. A delivery entered on the 5th against
 * the 3rd belongs to the 3rd, which is the same rule every other figure in
 * the app follows.
