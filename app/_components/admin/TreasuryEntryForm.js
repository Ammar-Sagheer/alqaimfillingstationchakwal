/**
 * One line of the safe's sheet: cash in, or cash out.
 *
 * BEHIND A DIALOG, AND IT WAS BUILT AS A STANDING FORM FIRST. The case for a
 * standing form is good and it lost to a measurement. This is the thing the
 * page exists for and it is used five or six times a day, so a tap in front of
 * every entry is a real cost - but the sheet has six columns (date, reason,
 * in, out, balance, remove), three of them money that must not wrap, and it
 * needs about 736px. Beside a 22rem form column at the 1152px cap the page
 * carried at the time, the table got 504px, and rendered that way THE BALANCE
 * COLUMN WAS OFF THE RIGHT-HAND EDGE, inside the table's own scroller - the one
 * column this page exists to show, and the DOM check reported no clipping while
 * it happened.
 *
 * The cap has since moved to 1360px for the 1600x900 laptop this is read on,
 * which would leave the table 952px and clear the 736px it needs. The dialog
 * stays anyway: the page still has to work below 1360, where the original
 * measurement is unchanged, and the answer should not depend on how wide the
 * window happens to be.
 * See "Layout: form beside a table" in docs/UI_CONVENTIONS.md, which says
 * exactly this: when the table does not fit the 1fr track, put the form behind
 * a dialog rather than fight the split.
 *
 * It is also the answer Readings arrived at on the app's busiest entry screen,
 * after inline was tried and reverted - so a dialog here is the app's settled
 * pattern rather than a consolation.
 *
 * THE CATEGORY IS A `<select>`, NOT THE ICON TILES Company Assets uses, and
 * that is the convention rather than an exception to it: tiles are right when
 * every option has an obvious symbol, and "Cash of shift closing", "Entry" and
 * "Money returned" have none. Drawn as tiles they would be five identical
 * boxes with a generic glyph in each. The hint line under the select does the
 * work an icon would have done.
 *
 * WHAT THE SAFE HOLDS IS ON SCREEN WHILE THE AMOUNT IS TYPED, and the form
 * says so before the database has to. A cash-out larger than the safe holds is
 * refused by a trigger in Postgres with a message naming the line it breaks on
 * (migration 044) - that is the rule. This is the courtesy: the owner should
 * find out he is about to type Rs 50,000 out of a safe holding Rs 8,364 while
 * he is looking at the amount box, not after pressing Save.
