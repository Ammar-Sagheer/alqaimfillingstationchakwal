/**
 * The app's navigation: a column down the left on a laptop, a drawer behind a
 * burger on a phone.
 *
 * WHY A COLUMN RATHER THAN A ROW OF TABS. There are ten sections, and with an
 * icon and a readable label each they need about 1350px laid out sideways -
 * more than the page has. As a top bar they either scrolled, hiding Reports and
 * Settings off the right-hand edge of every laptop, or wrapped onto a second
 * row that ate the top of every screen. Vertically there is no such squeeze:
 * ten items fit down the side of even a short window with room left over, all
 * visible at once, which is what someone still learning where things live
 * needs. It also gives each one a full-width band to hit rather than a word.
 *
 * WHY IT COSTS SOMETHING. 240px off the left means the widest table in the app
 * - Purchases, eight columns - scrolls inside its own card at 1024px, where
 * before it just fitted. That is the trade: a nav that is always visible
 * against one table that scrolls at one width. It scrolls inside the card, not
 * the page, so nothing else moves.
 *
 * The links a data_entry user cannot open are not rendered. This is
 * presentation only - typing the URL still hits requirePageRole(), and RLS
 * would refuse the data even then.
 *
 * Account and Sign out sit at the bottom, apart from the sections: they are
 * "about you", not a part of the app someone works in. Reports and Settings
 * come last among the sections for the same reason, being looked at
 * occasionally rather than worked in all day.
