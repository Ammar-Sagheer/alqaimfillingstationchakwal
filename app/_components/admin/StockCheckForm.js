 * The whole card wears its fuel's colour, not just a badge.
 *
 * Two cards side by side, identical but for a name, and the figures typed into
 * them are four-digit numbers that look alike - so petrol's reading going into
 * diesel's box is an easy slip and an expensive one, because a dip is the
 * baseline every later day is measured from.
 *
 * The colours themselves, and the reasoning behind the dark/light pairing, live
 * in `app/_lib/fuel-colors.js` - one definition shared with the badges, the
 * dashboard cards and the charts. Here the band and the border take them; the
 * BODY STAYS WHITE so the figures keep full contrast on a tablet in poor light.
 *
 * Colour is not the only cue and must not be. The tank name is large and bold
 * in the header, and the dip box's own label names the tank again - so the card
 * still reads correctly for anyone who cannot use the colours at all. The
 * FuelBadge that used to sit in this header is gone: on a band that is already
 * the fuel's colour, beside a name that already says "Petrol Tank", it said a
 * third time what had been said twice.

/*
 * A dip is a MOMENT, not a day, and which day it judges depends on when the rod
 * went in.
 *
 * This pump dips first thing in the morning, before the pumps are switched on,
 * so a dip taken on the 11th measures the tank as it stood at the close of the
 * 10th - and has to be compared against the 10th's books. Recording it against
 * the 11th, as the app did until migration 039, compared it against a book
 * figure that still had the 10th's fuel in it and reported a whole day's sales
 * as a loss, every single day.
 *
 * Morning is the default because it is the pump's routine. Both options are
 * legal and only the person holding the rod knows which is right, so this
 * follows the rule in docs/UI_CONVENTIONS.md for exactly that shape of control:
 * name the choice in plain words, then SHOW THE CONSEQUENCE - the day it closes
 * and the book figure that produces - before it is committed.
