/**
 * The daily entry screen, drawn - in the new look the Dashboard set.
 *
 * WHAT DID NOT CHANGE, ON PURPOSE. This page has more reverted designs recorded
 * against it than any other (docs/UI_CONVENTIONS.md): a day-completion strip
 * built three ways and removed, inline entry built and reverted ("model window
 * was better"), a dark strip across the top. None of that comes back. The unit
 * is still the card, entry is still a dialog with one nozzle in it, the unit
 * header still wears its fuel's band, entered nozzles are still washed in their
 * fuel's tint, and the cash-up bar still appears only once the totals at the
 * top have scrolled away. What changed is the surface: the day header, the
 * figure cards, the panels, the warnings and the dialog's insides.
