/**
 * One page of the ledger, newest first, with a running balance.
 *
 * Each row shows what was owed immediately after that entry - which is how a
 * paper khata reads.
 *
 * THE RUNNING BALANCE COMES FROM POSTGRES (`balance_after`, migration 064) and
 * is not worked out here, which it used to be: sort the rows oldest first, run
 * a total through them starting at zero. That was right while this table was
 * handed the WHOLE ledger, and wrong from the day it was handed a page of 25 -
 * zero is the balance before the customer's first ever entry, and that entry is
 * on the LAST page. Every figure in the column was out by the net of everything
 * older than the page; a customer owing Rs 97,515 read Rs -59,728 against his
 * newest entry, which is not just the wrong number but the wrong side of zero.
 * The card above the table and the printed statement were right throughout, so
 * the only thing broken was the column you would check them against - and that
 * is the one that has to be right, because it is where the owner looks when he
 * wants to know where a figure came from.
 *
 * It is summed over every row the customer has, so a row reads the same on
 * whichever page it falls, and the newest row equals the balance on the card.
 *
 * A CANCELLED ROW STAYS ON THE PAGE, STRUCK THROUGH. Nothing is ever deleted
 * here (the database refuses), so a corrected mistake leaves three rows: the
 * wrong one, the entry that cancelled it, and the replacement. Shown plainly
 * that is unreadable - three amounts, two of them meaningless, and no way to
 * tell which. So the cancelled row is struck and greyed and the cancelling row
 * is labelled, and the pair reads as one crossed-out line the way it would in a
 * register. The figures are still there to be checked; they have simply stopped
 * claiming to be live.
 *
 * BOTH ROWS KEEP THEIR PLACE IN THE RUNNING BALANCE. It would look tidier to
 * skip them, and it would be wrong: the balance column says what was owed after
 * each entry, and on the day between the mistake and its correction that really
 * was the figure. Striking the row says it is not the last word; removing it
 * from the arithmetic would make the column stop adding up.
