/**
 * A strongbox: the one icon in this set that is drawn here rather than
 * imported, because Material UI does not have it.
 *
 * The Treasury page is about cash locked in a safe ON SITE, and the whole
 * point of it is that this money is NOT in the banking system. Every money
 * glyph MUI offers says the opposite or says nothing: `Savings` is a piggy
 * bank (childlike, and the owner's verdict on it was immediate), `Lock` is a
 * padlock that says "security settings" in a list of nav items, `Payments` is
 * a stack of notes that would sit one row under `AccountBalance` saying much
 * the same thing, and `Shield`, `Toll` and `PointOfSale` are none of it.
 *
 * So: a box on feet, with a combination dial and a handle. It is a SHAPE
 * first - a squat rectangle among a column of round and pointed glyphs -
 * which is what has to survive at 20px in a dim office, and it is the shape of
 * the thing itself.
 *
 * FOUR MARKS, NOT SIX, and that was measured rather than guessed. The first
 * draft drew the door as a second rectangle inside the body with a small dial
 * on it, and rendered at 16px the two nested rectangles closed up and read as
 * a little screen or a banknote - which is exactly the confusion the icon
 * exists to avoid, sitting one row under Banking. Dropping the inner
 * rectangle and making the dial big enough to be seen as a dial is what makes
 * it legible small: body, dial, handle, feet.
 *
 * Drawn as strokes rather than MUI's filled outlines because at this size a
 * dial drawn as a fill is a dot. `vectorEffect` is deliberately NOT set: the
 * icon is only ever rendered at 16-24px, so the stroke does not need to resist
 * scaling, and leaving it off keeps the weight matched to the imported set at
 * the sizes actually used.
 *
 * It takes the same props MUI's icons take, so `Icon` treats it identically -
 * that is the contract COMPONENTS below depends on.

/**
 * The app's icons, backed by Material UI (`@mui/icons-material`, Outlined
 * variant throughout) at the owner's request. This file is still the single
 * place that decides what a name means - every call site in the app writes
 * `<Icon name="tank" className="h-5 w-5" />` exactly as it did with the old
 * hand-drawn set, so swapping the icon package cost this file only. Adding a
 * name means adding an import and a line in `COMPONENTS` below.
 *
 * WHY ICONS AT ALL. The app was entirely text: ten identically-shaped nav
 * tabs, and statuses told apart by two letters and a colour. That asks the
 * reader to parse a word every time, and it leans on colour alone for the
 * difference between a nozzle that is done and one that is not - which is
 * exactly what fades in a dim pump office and what a red-green colourblind
 * reader cannot see. An icon beside the word gives a second, redundant cue:
 * shape.
 *
 * They are decoration, never the only carrier of meaning - every icon here
 * sits next to its own label, and is `aria-hidden` so a screen reader is not
 * made to announce it twice. The single exception is `trash` inside an
 * IconButton, which carries its label in `aria-label` and `title` instead;
 * the reasoning is written up there.
 *
 * SIZING. `Icon` renders a fixed-size wrapper `<span>` (sized by the
 * `className` utility, e.g. `h-5 w-5`) with the MUI icon stretched to fill it
 * via an inline style. MUI's own `SvgIcon` sizes itself in `em` off the
 * ambient font-size through its own (Emotion-generated) CSS class, which can
 * land after Tailwind's utility classes in the stylesheet and win the
 * cascade - so trusting Tailwind's `h-5 w-5` on the icon directly was not
 * reliable. An inline style on the icon itself always wins, so the wrapper
 * is what carries the actual size and the icon just fills it. Colour is
 * untouched - no `color` prop is passed, so it keeps inheriting
 * `currentColor` from whatever text the icon sits beside, same as before.
